So I saw an interesting article called [Deploying to Pythonanywhere via Github](https://medium.com/@aadibajpai/deploying-to-pythonanywhere-via-github-6f967956e664). I've got the initial webhooks part working so I can just deploy to this site whenever I do a push to the main branch on github. I'll be looking at the security side of this tomorrow.
