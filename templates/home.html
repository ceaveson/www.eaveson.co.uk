My New Years resolution is to try and code every day even if just for 10 minutes. This site is a project I can work on as a part of trying to achieve my goal. Also it will track my progress. :)

<p>
If the coding I do is for work then there will be little to no detail on what I've done that day. If it's a change to this site then this should be reflected on it's <a href="https://github.com/ceaveson/www.eaveson.co.uk">Github page</a>.

        This is the first day. Well started before midnight and coded into the new day. Started with some basic setup of the site including:
        <ul>
            <li>Setup hosting on Python Anywhere</li>
            <li>Start simple Flask App with templates</li>
            <li>Add Bootstrap for styling</li>
        </ul>
