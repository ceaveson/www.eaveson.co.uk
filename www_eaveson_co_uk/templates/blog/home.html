My New Years resolution is to try and code every day even if just for 10 minutes. This site is a project I can work on as a part of trying to achieve my goal. Also it will track my progress. :)
</p>
<p>
If the coding I do is for work then there will be little to no detail on what I've done that day. If it's a change to this site then this should be reflected on it's <a href="https://github.com/ceaveson/www.eaveson.co.uk">Github page</a>.

            So i've decided on writting my posts in markdown as it's something i'd like to start making more use of anyway. I found <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-python-markdown-with-flask-and-sqlite">this</a> tutorial which I very loosly followed to add the support. So now I can create new posts from markdown on a very basic page:<br>
            <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='img/add_new_post_md.png')}}" style="width:500px;"><br>
            Submitting this saves the markdown text to a database. When a view is requested that has this content then the markdown stored in the database gets converted to html and added to the page:<br>
            <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='img/md_post_example.png')}}" style="width:500px;"><br>
            These example screenshots are from a test route so not actually how the real posts are actually stored. I'll convert them to markdown and add to the database for use in a later coding session. Also the bullet points are all numbered on the second screenshot where I would have expected the second lot to just be circles, so that is also something to look into.<br><br>

            <p>I've now finished converting the site to a package and use blueprints which helps to organise the structure. I've made similar flask sites previously but it's funny how you forget how to do some things. One issue I had was with circular dependencies which <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22929839/circular-import-of-db-reference-using-flask-sqlalchemy-and-blueprints">this</a> Stack Overflow post was helpful with resolving.</p>
            <p>I need to do some thinking about how I'm going to add daily posts on a form for when I add entries to a database as i'd like it to be fairly easy to use and also still be able to upload and use pictures in the posts.</p>

            I had a look at this again today and the MySQL database was working. Wondering if it was just a cache issue yesterday. I've now started the process of changing the site to a package and also introducing blueprints, to be continued tomorrow.

        I've created a MySQL database on Python Anywhere and trying to hook up to my Flask code but getting some issues that I will continue to debug tomorrow.

            On the website code on my computer i've now used flask-sqlalchemy and created a local sqlite3 database for the posts (will use MySQL in production). I also got this showing on a test page on the site and using the date function from yesterday to format the date how I wanted.<br><br>
            The following is a screenshot of a couple of test entries
            <img src="{{url_for('static', filename='img/test_posts_from_db_1.png')}}" style="width:500px;">

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-4"><h4>5th January 2023</h4></div>
        <div class="col-8">
            Eventually i'll add these daily entries into a database rather than onto a static HTML file. I'd like to also keep the date format as "5th January 2023" with the day suffix however it looks like the datetime library doesn't have this functionality so i've made a little function to do that for when I want to automate adding the date to each entry.<br>

            So I saw an interesting article called <a href="https://medium.com/@aadibajpai/deploying-to-pythonanywhere-via-github-6f967956e664"> Deploying to Pythonanywhere via Github</a>. I've got the initial webhooks part working so I can just deploy to this site whenever I do a push to the main branch on github. I'll be looking at the security side of this tomorrow.<br><br>

            Day 2 and I decided to go through the <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/tutorial/">Flask Tutorial</a> as it has been a long while since I have last had a look through it and things seem to have changed. It was mostly reading and doing copy and pastes however I received errors when running tests. I added a post to Reddit r/learnpython to see if they could help me understand what's happening.<br>
            My code which as I said is pretty much copy and pastes is on Github <a href ="https://github.com/ceaveson/flask-tutorial">here</a>

        This is the first day. Well started before midnight and coded into the new day. Started with some basic setup of the site including:
        <ul>
            <li>Setup hosting on Python Anywhere</li>
            <li>Start simple Flask App with templates</li>
            <li>Add Bootstrap for styling</li>
        </ul>
