My New Years resolution is to try and code every day even if just for 10 minutes. This site is a project I can work on as a part of trying to achieve my goal. Also it will track my progress. :)
</p>
<p>
If the coding I do is for work then there will be little to no detail on what I've done that day. If it's a change to this site then this should be reflected on it's <a href="https://github.com/ceaveson/www.eaveson.co.uk">Github page</a>.
